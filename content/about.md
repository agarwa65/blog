I am currently a software engineer at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/). I was previously working at [Delphi Automotive/Aptiv](https://www.aptiv.com/) in their self-driving division in California.

During my time at Aptiv, I made software tools for lidar data visualization and implemented algorithms for allowing HD map based localization. 

I have patents with Aptiv and a patent recently filed with Microsoft.

My interests lie in Software Programming, Autonomous Vehicles, Deep Learning and Mapping.
