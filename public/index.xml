      <description>I am currently a software engineer at Microsoft. I was previously working at Delphi Automotive/Aptiv in their self-driving division in California.
During my time at Aptiv, I made software tools for lidar data visualization and implemented algorithms for allowing HD map based localization.
I have patent filings from Aptiv and Microsoft.
My interests lie in Software Programming, Autonomous Vehicles, Deep Learning and Mapping.</description>
